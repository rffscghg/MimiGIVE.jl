    "_Mortality_cdf_spp_country_extensions.csv_ was recieved from David Smith (EPA) on October 8, 2021, and holds the SSP mortality data with extensions out to 2300. The raw data out to 2100 are stored at the [Wittgenstein Centre](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdataexplorer.wittgensteincentre.org%2Fwcde-v2%2F&data=04%7C01%7Crennert%40rff.org%7C96cba6d9096647c0159f08d98a001bc0%7Cb29f848db9144be4ad1f89bdbdb8030a%7C0%7C1%7C637692555407649003%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=Ji7h6eHB2mHnEaCco3RvbvpDP1j4PMcNHdRa2pdgMYQ%3D&reserved=0) and can be accessed in R by using the [wcde](https://guyabel.github.io/wcde/) package. Samir KC and Wolfgang Lutz, the two original authors of the population projections, are jointly appointed to IIASA and to the Wittgenstein Center. This database only has data for SSPs 1 through 3. Based on [KC and Lutz et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001095)it appears that the mortality assumptions are similar for SSP2 and SPP4 and for SSP1 and SSP5, this assumption is adopted and SSP1 is used as a proxy for SSP5 and SSP2 as a proxy for SSP4, for this variable. For the projections, the crude death rate post-2100 for each country converging towards the 2100 world crude death (by SSP). All countries reach the 2100 world crude death rate in 2300. Data exists for 200 countries. Units for the crude death rate are number of deaths occurring over a five-year period (period ends on the year in the year column) per 1,000 total population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post processing of these data for our use is as follows, and produces _Mortality_cdf_ssp_country_extensions_annual.csv_. To downscale these data from five year increments to annual deaths per 1000 people, the interval value is divided value by the population in the middle of the interval, multiply by 1000 (people), and divide by the time interval (5 years). Note that because of this recommended post processing step this needs to be done ahead of time for each potential population scenario that will be employed, and adjusted if population scenarios change."

This results in 9,800 remaining trials (dropping 200). The _rffsps_1ct_trimmed.csv_ file holds this constrained sample of 9,800 trial IDs.\n",
